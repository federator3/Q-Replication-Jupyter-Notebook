# Q-Replication-Jupyter-Notebook

This set of Jupyter Notebooks can be used to display status, performance, and health of an IBM Q Replication setup. The following components are provided:

    * Q Capture Jupyter Notebook 
    * Q Apply Jupyter Notebook
    * Q Replication function library Jupyter Notebook
    * A set of SQL queries in files (asnmonitor) for status calculation and quality assurance. These are maintained the the git repository federator3/Q-Replication-Monitoring

The Notebooks display the content of the IBM Q Replication control tables. This includes an overall health summary for both Q Capture and Q Apply, performance graphs (throughput, latency, etc.), and control table details for both queues and subscriptions.
